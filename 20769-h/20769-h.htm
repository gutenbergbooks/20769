<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>Considering the ease with which a knowledge of the constellations can
be acquired, it seems a remarkable fact that so few are conversant
with these time-honored configurations of the heavens. Aside from a
knowledge of "the Dipper" and "the Pleiades," the constellations to
the vast majority, are utterly unknown.</p>

<p>To facilitate and popularize if possible this fascinating recreation
of star-gazing the author has designed this field-book. It is limited
in scope solely to that purpose, and all matter of a technical or
theoretical nature has been omitted.</p>

<p>The endeavor has been to include in these pages only such matter as
the reader can observe with the naked eye, or an opera-glass.
Simplicity and brevity have been aimed at, the main idea being that
whatever is bulky or verbose is a hindrance rather than a help when
actually engaged in the observation of the heavens.</p>

<p>The constellations embraced in this manual are only those visible from
the average latitude of the New England and Middle States, and owe
their place in the particular season in which they are found to the
fact that in that season they are favorably situated for observation.</p>

<p>With this brief explanatory note of the purpose and design of the
book, the author proceeds to outline the scheme of study.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg&nbsp;v]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="SCHEME_OF_STUDY" id="SCHEME_OF_STUDY"></a>SCHEME OF STUDY.</h2>


<p>The table of contents shows the scheme of study to be pursued, and to
facilitate the work it is desirable that the student follow the
therein circumscribed order.</p>

<p>A knowledge on the part of the reader of Ursa Major, or "the Dipper"
as it is commonly called, and "the Pleiades," the well-known group in
Taurus, is presupposed by the author.</p>

<p>With this knowledge as a basis, the student is enabled in any season
to take up the study of the constellations. By following out the order
dictated, he will in a few nights of observation be enabled to
identify the various configurations making up the several
constellations that are set apart for study in that particular season.</p>

<p>A large plate, showing the appearance of the heavens at a designated
time on the first night of the quarter, is inserted before each
season's work. This should be consulted by the student before he makes
an observation, in order that he may obtain a comprehensive idea of
the relative position of the constellations, and also know in what
part of the heavens to locate the constellation which he wishes to
identify.</p>

<p>A knowledge of one constellation enables the student<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg&nbsp;vi]</a></span> to determine the
position of the next in order. In this work, the identification of
each constellation depends on a knowledge of what precedes, always
bearing in mind the fact that each season starts as a new and distinct
part to be taken by itself, and has no bearing on that which comes
before.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg&nbsp;vii]</a></span></p>

they indicate the positions of the constellations as they appear at 9
o'clock <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> in mid-season.</p>

<p>To facilitate finding and observing the constellations, the student
should face in the direction indicated in the text. This applies to
all constellations excepting those near the zenith.</p>

<p>The four large plates are so arranged that the observer is supposed to
be looking at the southern skies. By turning the plate about from left
to right, the eastern, northern, and western skies are shown
successively.</p>

<p>On many of the diagrams the position of nebul&aelig; is indicated. These are
designated by the initial letter of the astronomer who catalogued
them, preceded by his catalogue number, as for instance 8 M. signifies
nebula number 8 in Messier's catalogue.</p>

<p>The magnitudes assigned to the stars in the diagrams are derived from
the Harvard Photometry. When a star is midway between two magnitudes
the numeral is underlined, thus <span class="u">2</span>, indicates a star of magnitude 2.5.</p>

<p>If a star's magnitude is between 1 and 1.5 it is regarded as a
first-magnitude star. If it lies between 1.5 and 2 it is designated
second magnitude.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_1" id="Page_1">[Pg&nbsp;1]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Location.</span>&mdash;Ursa Major is probably the best known of the
constellations, and in this work I presuppose that the reader is
familiar with its position in the heavens. It is one of the most noted
and conspicuous constellations in the northern hemisphere, and is
readily and unmistakably distinguished from all others by means of a
remarkable cluster of seven bright stars in the northern heavens,
forming what is familiarly termed "The Dipper."</p>

<p>The stars <ins class="character" title="Greek alpha">&#945;</ins> and <ins class="character" title="Greek beta">&#946;</ins> are called the pointers, because they always point
toward the Pole Star, 28&frac34;&deg; distant from <ins class="character" title="Greek alpha">&#945;</ins>.</p>

<p>Alioth is very nearly opposite Shedir in Cassiopeia, and at an equal
distance from the Pole. The same can be said of Megres, in Ursa Major,
and Caph, in Cassiopeia.</p>

<p>The star <ins class="character" title="Greek omicron">&#959;</ins> is at the tip of the Bear's nose. A clearly defined
semicircle begins at <ins class="character" title="Greek omicron">&#959;</ins> and ends in the pair <ins class="character" title="Greek iota">&#953;</ins> and <ins class="character" title="Greek kappa">&#954;</ins> at the extremity
of the Bear's right fore paw. This group of stars resembles a sickle.
Note little Alcor close to Mizar. This star was used by the Arabs as a
test of good eyesight.</p>

<p>Mizar and Alcor are known as the horse and his rider.</p>

<p>This plate shows the Bear lying on his back, his feet projected up the
sky; three conspicuous pairs of stars represent three of his four
feet.</p>

<p>The Chaldean shepherds and the Iroquois Indians gave to this
constellation the same name. The Egyptians called it "The Thigh."</p>

<p><ins class="character" title="Greek alpha">&#945;</ins> and <ins class="character" title="Greek eta">&#951;</ins> are moving through space in a contrary direction to the
remaining five stars in "The Dipper."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg&nbsp;5]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Location</span>.&mdash;The two pointer stars in Ursa Major indicate the position
of Polaris, the North Star, which represents the tip of the tail of
the Little Bear, and the end of the handle of the "Little Dipper." In
all ages of the world, Ursa Minor has been more universally observed
and more carefully noticed than any other constellation, on account of
the importance of the North Star.</p>

<p>Polaris is a little more than 1&frac14;&deg; from the true pole. Its light
takes fifty years to reach us.</p>

<p>A line joining <ins class="character" title="Greek beta">&#946;</ins> Cassiopei&aelig;, and Megres, in Ursa Major, will pass
through Polaris.</p>

<p>At the distance of the nearest fixed star our sun would shine as a
star no brighter than Polaris which is presumably about the sun's
size.</p>

<p>Polaris revolves around the true pole once in twenty-four hours in a
little circle 2&frac12;&deg; in diameter. Within this circle two hundred stars
have been photographed.</p>

<p>The North Star is always elevated as many degrees above the horizon as
the observer is north of the equator.</p>

<p>Compare the light of the four stars forming the bowl of the "Little
Dipper," as they are each of a different magnitude. A standard
first-magnitude star is 2&frac12; times brighter than a standard second
magnitude star, etc.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg&nbsp;7]</a></span></p>

equal distance ends near Castor, in Gemini. Gemini is characterized by
two nearly parallel rows of stars. The northern row if extended would
reach Taurus, the southern one Orion. Note the fine cluster 35 M.
Herschel discovered Uranus in 1781 a short distance southwest of it.
Two wonderful streams of little stars run parallel northwest on each
side of the cluster. Where the ecliptic crosses the solstitial colure
is the spot where the sun appears to be when it is farthest north of
the equator, June 21st. Castor is a fine double for a telescope, and
Pollux has three little attendant stars. An isoceles triangle is
formed by Castor, Aldebaran in Taurus, and Capella in Auriga. There is
a record of an occultation in Gemini noted about the middle of the
fourth century <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>

<p>The Arabs saw in this group of stars two peacocks, the Egyptians two
sprouting plants, and the Hindus twin deities, while in the Buddhist
zodiac they represented a woman holding a golden cord. Since classic
times, however, the figure has always been that of human twins.</p>

<p>At the point indicated near <ins class="character" title="Greek theta">&#952;</ins> a new star was discovered by Enebo in
March, 1912. It attained a maximum of about magnitude 3.5 and has at
this writing waned to the eleventh magnitude.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg&nbsp;9]</a></span></p>

45&deg;, ends near the bright Capella, in Auriga, a star of the first
magnitude, and one of the most brilliant in the heavens. It is
unmistakable, having no rival in brightness near it. Auriga is a
beautiful and conspicuous constellation. It is characterized by a
clearly defined pentagon. Note the three fourth-magnitude stars near
Capella known as "The Kids." The star <ins class="character" title="Greek beta">&#946;</ins> is common to Auriga and
Taurus, being the former's right foot and the latter's northern horn.
The field within the pentagon is particularly rich in clusters.
Capella forms a rude square with Polaris, <ins class="character" title="Greek epsilon">&#949;</ins> Cassiopei&aelig;, and <ins class="character" title="Greek omicron">&#959;</ins> Urs&aelig;
Majoris, and forms an equilateral triangle with Betelgeuze in Orion,

<p>A line from <ins class="character" title="Greek theta">&#952;</ins> to <ins class="character" title="Greek alpha">&#945;</ins> Aurig&aelig; prolonged about 20&deg; ends near <ins class="character" title="Greek alpha">&#945;</ins> Persei.</p>

<p>Capella is visible at some hour of every clear night throughout the
year. Of the first-magnitude stars it is nearest to the Pole, and it
rises almost exactly in the northeast.</p>

<p>To the Arabs Capella was "The Driver," because it seemed to rise
earlier than the other stars and so apparently watched over them, or
still more practically as "The Singer" who rode before the procession
cheering on the camels, which last were represented by the Pleiades.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg&nbsp;11]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Location</span>.&mdash;Cancer lies between Gemini and Leo. A line drawn from Nath
in Auriga to Pollux in Gemini, and prolonged about 15&deg;, ends in
Pr&aelig;sepe, the Manger, the great star cluster in Cancer, which is also
called "The Bee Hive." It contains 300 stars. The stars <ins class="character" title="Greek gamma">&#947;</ins> and <ins class="character" title="Greek delta">&#948;</ins> are
called the Aselli&mdash;the ass's colts feeding from the silver manger.</p>

<p>The star <ins class="character" title="Greek beta">&#946;</ins> lies about 10&deg; northeast of Procyon. Acubens, <ins class="character" title="Greek alpha">&#945;</ins> lies on the
same line the same distance beyond <ins class="character" title="Greek beta">&#946;</ins>. These two stars form the tips of
the inverted "Y" which distinguishes Cancer.</p>

<p>An imaginary line from Capella through Pollux will point out Acubens.
Close to it are two faint stars. The Bee Hive lies within an irregular
square formed by <ins class="character" title="Greek gamma">&#947;</ins>, <ins class="character" title="Greek delta">&#948;</ins>, <ins class="character" title="Greek eta">&#951;</ins>, and <ins class="character" title="Greek theta">&#952;</ins>, and looks like a nebula to the naked
eye.</p>

<p>In June, 1895, all the planets except Neptune were in this quarter of
the heavens, and Halley's comet was in this constellation on its first
appearance in 1531.</p>

<p>The dimness of <ins class="character" title="Greek gamma">&#947;</ins> and <ins class="character" title="Greek delta">&#948;</ins> is an infallible precursor of rain, and if the

that constellation, and forms a rhomboidal figure of five stars.</p>

<p>Hydra is about 100&deg; in length and reaches almost from Canis Minor to
Libra. Its stars are all faint except Alphard, or the Hydra's heart, a
second-magnitude star remarkable for its lonely situation, southwest
of Regulus, in Leo. A line drawn from <ins class="character" title="Greek gamma">&#947;</ins> Leonis through Regulus points
it out. It is of a rich orange tint. Castor and Pollux, in Gemini,
point southeast to it.</p>

<p>The constellations Crater, the Cup, and Corvus, the Crow, both stand
on the coils of Hydra, south of Denebola, the bright star in the tail
of the Lion.</p>

<p>Hydra is supposed to be the snake shown on a uranographic stone from
the Euphrates, 1200 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>

<p>Leo is one of the most beautiful constellations in the zodiac. It lies
south of the Great Bear, and its principal stars are arranged in the
form of a sickle which nearly outlines the Lion's head. This group is
so striking as to be unmistakable. Regulus is in the handle of the
sickle. It is one of the stars from which longitude is reckoned, lies
almost exactly on the ecliptic, and is visible for eight months in the
year.</p>

<p>Denebola, the bright star in the Lion's tail, lies 25&deg; east of
Regulus, and about 35&deg; west of Arcturus, in Bo&ouml;tes. It is the same

<p>Procyon was distinctly mentioned by Ptolemy. It rises in this latitude
a little north of east about half an hour before Sirius, the Dog Star,
hence it was called Procyon from two Greek words which signify "before

forming an equilateral triangle with <ins class="character" title="Greek alpha">&#945;</ins> and <ins class="character" title="Greek gamma">&#947;</ins>, stars of the same
magnitude 6&deg; south and east of it.</p>

<p>Corvus and Crater are to be seen half-way up the southern sky during
the early evenings in spring.</p>

<p><ins class="character" title="Greek delta">&#948;</ins> is now the lucida.</p>

<p>Crater is situated at about the centre of Hydra and is on the
meridian, April 26th. Owing to its many faint stars it is best seen on
a clear moonless night.</p>

<p>The zodiacal light is well worth observing at this season of the year.
It is to be seen in the western sky shortly after sundown, and is most
intense during the evenings of March.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg&nbsp;25]</a></span></p>

two more stars in Draco, which form with two stars in Ursa Major a
quadrilateral. (See diagram.) Draco now curves sharply eastward,
coiling about the Little Bear as shown, then turns abruptly southerly,
ending in a characteristic and clearly defined group of four stars,
forming an irregular square, representing the Dragon's head. This
group is almost overhead in the early evening in summer. The star in
the heel of Hercules lies just south of the Dragon's head. The
brilliant Vega will be seen about overhead, 12&deg; southwest of the
Dragon's head. Eltanin, one of the Dragon's eyes, is noted for its
connection with the discovery of the law of aberration of light. It is
of an orange hue, while the star <ins class="character" title="Greek beta">&#946;</ins>, near it, is white. Note Thuban,
once the Pole Star, at one corner of a quadrilateral that Draco forms
with Ursa Major.</p>

<p>Thuban could be seen by day or night from the bottom of the central
passage of several of the Pyramids in Egypt.</p>

<p>The rising of Eltanin was visible about thirty-five hundred years <span class="smcap">b.c.</span>
through the central passages of the temples of Hathor at Denderah. The
Egyptians called Draco "The Hippopotamus."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Location</span>.&mdash;Lyra may be easily distinguished because of the brilliant
Vega, its brightest star, which is situated about 12&deg; southwest of the
Dragon's head. It is unmistakable, as it is the brightest star in this
region of the heavens, and the third brightest in this latitude. In
July and August Vega is close to the zenith in the early evening.</p>

<p>The six bright stars in Lyra form an equilateral triangle on one
corner of a rhomboid. A very characteristic figure.</p>

<p><ins class="character" title="Greek epsilon">&#949;</ins> is a pretty double for an opera-glass, and a 3" glass reveals the
duplicity of each star of this pair. <ins class="character" title="Greek epsilon">&#949;</ins> is therefore a double double.</p>

<p><ins class="character" title="Greek zeta">&#950;</ins> is a double for a good glass.</p>

<p><ins class="character" title="Greek beta">&#946;</ins> is a variable, changing from magnitude 3.4 to 4.4 in twelve days. At
its brightest it is about equal to its near neighbor <ins class="character" title="Greek gamma">&#947;</ins> Lyr&aelig;.</p>

<p>The noted ring nebula lies between <ins class="character" title="Greek beta">&#946;</ins> and <ins class="character" title="Greek gamma">&#947;</ins>. A 3" glass reveals it but
a powerful telescope is required to render its details visible.</p>

<p>If the distance from the earth to the sun equalled one inch, the
distance from the earth to Vega would be 158 miles.</p>

<p>Vega was the first star to be photographed, in 1850. It is visible at
some hour every clear night, and has been called the arc-light of the
sky. Its light has the bluish-white hue that suggests "a diamond in
the sky."</p>

<p>The spectroscope reveals that Vega is a star probably only in its
infancy, as hydrogen is its predominating element.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg&nbsp;35]</a></span></p>

Vega and Altair in Aquila&mdash;Altair being at the apex, about 35&deg; from
Deneb and Vega.</p>

stars in a line, the middle one much brighter than the other two. This
bright star is Altair, in Aquila. It forms with Vega and Deneb an

two. A triangle is formed by Vega, Altair, and Ras Alhague, in the
Serpent Bearer, which is about 30&deg; west of Altair.</p>

<p>This is a double constellation composed of Aquila and Antino&uuml;s. Altair

<p><span class="smcap">Location</span>.&mdash;Scorpius, one of the signs of the zodiac, is a beautiful
star group, and one that is easily traced out. It lies just under the
Serpent Bearer, between Sagittarius and Libra.</p>

<p>The resemblance to a Scorpion is not difficult to see, hence this
constellation is perhaps the most aptly named of any.</p>

<p>The ruddy star Antares, the brightest star in the constellation, is in
the heart of the Scorpion. It lies about 40&deg; southwest of Ras Alhague,
in Ophiuchus, and a little over 20&deg; west of the bow of Sagittarius.
The fact that it is the most brilliant star in this region of the sky
renders its identity unmistakable. It is one of the reddest stars in
the firmament.</p>

<p>There are several star clusters and double stars to be seen in this
constellation. Their position is indicated in the diagram.</p>

<p>The curved tail of the Scorpion is very conspicuous. <ins class="character" title="Greek lamda">&#955;</ins> and <ins class="character" title="Greek upsilon">&#965;</ins> are a
striking pair and the fine clusters above them can be seen with the
naked eye.</p>

<p>A record of a lunar occultation of <ins class="character" title="Greek beta">&#946;</ins> Scorpii in 295 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> is extant.</p>

<p>Note a pair just below <ins class="character" title="Greek beta">&#946;</ins>. They are known as <ins class="character" title="Greek omega">&#969;</ins><sup>1</sup> and <ins class="character" title="Greek omega">&#969;</ins><sup>2</sup>.</p>

<p>In this region of the sky have appeared many of the brilliant
temporary stars, the first one in astronomical annals being discovered
in 134 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span></p>

<p>Scorpius is mentioned by all the early writers on astronomy and is

<p><span class="smcap">Location</span>.&mdash;Libra is one of the signs of the zodiac, and lies between
Virgo and Scorpius. Its two chief stars, <ins class="character" title="Greek alpha">&#945;</ins> and <ins class="character" title="Greek beta">&#946;</ins>, may be recognized
west of and above the head of the Scorpion.</p>

<p>The star <ins class="character" title="Greek iota">&#953;</ins> Libr&aelig; is about 20&deg; northwest of Antares in the Scorpion.
Spica in Virgo, a star of the first magnitude, is a little over 20&deg;
northwest of <ins class="character" title="Greek alpha">&#945;</ins> Libr&aelig;.</p>

<p>A quadrilateral is formed by the stars <ins class="character" title="Greek alpha">&#945;</ins>, <ins class="character" title="Greek beta">&#946;</ins>, <ins class="character" title="Greek gamma">&#947;</ins>, <ins class="character" title="Greek epsilon">&#949;</ins>, which characterizes
the constellation.</p>

<p>The star <ins class="character" title="Greek alpha">&#945;</ins> Libr&aelig; looks elongated. An opera-glass shows that it has a
fifth-magnitude companion.</p>

<p><ins class="character" title="Greek beta">&#946;</ins> is a pale green star. Its color is very unusual.</p>

<p>Lyra, Corona, and Hercules are almost directly overhead in the early
evening, during July and August, and can best be observed in a
reclining position. Thus placed, with an opera-glass to assist the
vision, you may study to the best advantage the wonderful sight spread
out before you, and search depths only measured by the power of your
glass.</p>

<p>When the sun enters the sign Libra the days and nights are equal all
over the world and seem to observe a certain equilibrium like a
balance, hence the name of the constellation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg&nbsp;49]</a></span></p>

little over 40&deg;, terminates in the Crown, which lies between Hercules
and Bo&ouml;tes, and just above the diamond-shaped group of stars in the
head of the Serpent.</p>

<p>The characteristic semicircle resembling a crown is easily traced out.
The principal stars are of the fourth magnitude excepting Gemma, which
is a second-magnitude star and known as the "Pearl of the Crown."</p>

<p>Gemma, sometimes called Alphacca, forms with the stars Seginus and
Arcturus, in Bo&ouml;tes, an isosceles triangle, the vertex of which is at
Arcturus.</p>

<p>Close to <ins class="character" title="Greek epsilon">&#949;</ins> a famous temporary appeared suddenly May 12, 1866, as a
second-magnitude star. It was known as the "Blaze Star" and was
visible to the naked eye only eight days, fading at that time to a
tenth-magnitude star, and then rising to an eighth-magnitude, where it
still remains.</p>

<p>The native Australians called this constellation "The Boomerang." To
the Hebrews it was "Ataroth" and by this name it is known in the East
to-day. No two of the seven stars composing the Crown are moving in
the same direction or at the same rate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Location</span>.&mdash;A line drawn from either Vega, in Lyra, or Altair, in
Aquila, to Gemma, in Corona Borealis, passes through this
constellation. The left foot of Hercules rests on the head of Draco,
on the north, and his head nearly touches the head of Ophiuchus on the
south.</p>

<p>The star in the head of Hercules, Ras Algethi, is about 25&deg; southeast
of Corona Borealis.</p>

<p><ins class="character" title="Greek alpha">&#945;</ins> Ophiuchi and <ins class="character" title="Greek alpha">&#945;</ins> Herculis are only about 5&deg; apart.</p>

<p>The cluster 13 M., the Halley Nebula, can be easily seen in an
opera-glass. In a recent photograph of this cluster 50,000 stars are
shown in an area of sky which would be entirely covered by the full
moon.</p>

<p>Hercules occupies the part of the heavens toward which the sun is
bearing the earth and planets at the rate of twelve miles a second or
373 million miles a year.</p>

<p>On a clear night the asterism Cerberus, the three-headed dog, which
Hercules holds in his hand, can be seen.</p>

<p>This constellation is said to have been an object of worship in
Ph&#339;nicia. There is a good deal of mystery about its origin. The
ancient Greeks called it "The Phantom" and "The Man upon his Knees."</p>

<p>The stars <ins class="character" title="Greek epsilon">&#949;</ins>, <ins class="character" title="Greek zeta">&#950;</ins>, <ins class="character" title="Greek eta">&#951;</ins>, and <ins class="character" title="Greek pi">&#960;</ins> form a keystone shaped figure that serves to

<p><span class="smcap">Location</span>.&mdash;Bo&ouml;tes lies just west of the Crown, and east of Cor Caroli.
It may be easily distinguished by the position and splendor of its
principal star, Arcturus, which shines with a golden yellow lustre. It
is about 35&deg; east of Denebola, in Leo, and nearly as far north of
Spica, in Virgo, and forms with these two a large equilateral
triangle. A line drawn from <ins class="character" title="Greek zeta">&#950;</ins> to <ins class="character" title="Greek eta">&#951;</ins> Urs&aelig; Majoris and prolonged about

length.</p>

<p>The brightest stars in Bo&ouml;tes outline a characteristic kite-shaped
figure. Arcturus is mentioned in the Book of Job and is often referred
to as "The Star of Job."</p>

<p>Three stars of the fourth magnitude are situated in the right hand.
They are about 5&deg; north of <ins class="character" title="Greek eta">&#951;</ins> Urs&aelig; Majoris.</p>

<p>Contrast the color of Arcturus with Spica, Antares, and Vega.</p>

<p>The trapezium <ins class="character" title="Greek beta">&#946;</ins>, <ins class="character" title="Greek gamma">&#947;</ins>, <ins class="character" title="Greek delta">&#948;</ins>, and <ins class="character" title="Greek mu">&#956;</ins>, was called "The Female Wolves," by the

constellation as "The Vociferator."</p>

<p>Arcturus is the fourth brightest star in the northern hemisphere. It
is 1000 times the size of our sun and rushes through space toward
Virgo at the astounding rate of ninety miles a second. It is forty
light years distant.</p>

<p>The ancient Greeks called this constellation "Lycaon," a name which
signifies a Wolf. The Hebrew name for it was "The Barking Dog."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg&nbsp;55]</a></span></p>

rude "W," but in mid-autumn, to an observer facing north, the "W"
appears more like an "M," and is almost overhead. Note the spot marked
1572. This is where a very famous temporary star appeared in that

The star <ins class="character" title="Greek eta">&#951;</ins> is sixteen light years distant.</p>

<p>Caph is equidistant from the Pole, and exactly opposite the star
Megres in Ursa Major; with <ins class="character" title="Greek alpha">&#945;</ins> Andromed&aelig; and <ins class="character" title="Greek gamma">&#947;</ins> Pegasi it marks the

Cepheus is an inconspicuous constellation, lying partly in the Milky
Way. A view of this constellation through an opera-glass will repay
the observer. Cepheus is characterized by a rude square, one side of
which is the base of an isosceles triangle. Look for the so-called
garnet star <ins class="character" title="Greek mu">&#956;</ins>, probably the reddest star visible to the naked eye in
the United States. The star <ins class="character" title="Greek zeta">&#950;</ins> has a blue companion star.</p>

corner is marked by the star Alpheratz in Andromeda. Each side of the
square is about 18&deg; long.</p>

<p>The horse is generally seen upside down, with his fore feet projected
up into the sky. Only the head, neck, and fore feet are represented.
The star Enif marks the nose.</p>

<p><ins class="character" title="Greek pi">&#960;</ins> is an interesting double, easily seen in an opera-glass. All the

Horse's Head, is shown in the diagram.</p>

<p>Delphinus, the water jar of Aquarius, and the circlet in the Western

stars <ins class="character" title="Greek gamma">&#947;</ins> Andromed&aelig;, Algol, and <ins class="character" title="Greek alpha">&#945;</ins> Persei form a right-angled triangle.
The right angle is marked by Algol.</p>

<p>The chief object of interest in this constellation is the great
nebula, the first to be discovered. It can be seen by the naked eye
and it is a fine sight in an opera-glass. Its location is indicated in
the diagram.</p>

<p>The star <ins class="character" title="Greek gamma">&#947;</ins> is the radiant point of the Bielid meteors, looked for in
November. It is a colored double visible in a 3" glass.</p>

<p>The great nebula has been called the "Queen of the Nebul&aelig;." It is said
to have been known as far back as <span class="smcap">a.d.</span> 905, and it was described 986

about 9&deg; from the latter. The most striking feature in Perseus is the
so-called "segment of Perseus," a curve of stars beginning about 12&deg;
below Cassiopeia, and curving toward Ursa Major. Note the famous
variable Algol the Demon star. It represents the Medusa's head which
Perseus holds in his hand. It varies from the second to the fourth
magnitude in about three and one-half hours, and back again in the
same time, after which it remains steadily brilliant for two and
three-quarters days, when the same change recurs. Algenib and Algol
form with <ins class="character" title="Greek gamma">&#947;</ins> Andromed&aelig;, a right-angled triangle.</p>

<p>Note a dull red star near Algol, and a pretty pair just above Algenib.</p>

<p>An opera-glass reveals much that is worthy of observation in this
region of the sky. It has been said of the clusters between Cassiopeia
and Perseus that they form the most striking sidereal spectacle in the
northern heavens. They are visible to the naked eye. Algenib never
sets in the latitude of New York, just touching the horizon at its
lower culmination. It is estimated that Algol is a little over a
million miles in diameter, <ins class="character" title="Greek eta">&#951;</ins> has three faint stars on one side nearly
in a line, and one on the other&mdash;a miniature representation of Jupiter
and his satellites.</p>

<p>Algol, when on the meridian of New York City, is only one tenth of a
degree from the zenith point. This remarkable variable has a dark
companion star revolving near it obscuring its light in part from us
at stated intervals. By means of the spectroscope the speed diameter
and mass of this invisible star has been reckoned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg&nbsp;75]</a></span></p>

<p>Below <ins class="character" title="Greek omega">&#969;</ins>, and to the east of <ins class="character" title="Greek lamda">&#955;</ins> the spot marked (*) is the place which
the sun occupies at the time of the equinox. It is one of the two
crossing places of the equinoctial, or equator, of the heavens, and
the ecliptic, or sun's path.</p>

<p>Below Pisces is Cetus, the Whale.</p>

<p>Pisces is thought to have taken its name from its coincidence with the
sun during the rainy season.</p>

<p>Three distinct conjunctions of Jupiter and Saturn took place in this
constellation in the year 747 of Rome.</p>

<p>Pisces was considered the national constellation of the Jews, as well
as a tribal symbol.</p>

<p>In 1881, Jupiter, Saturn, and Venus were grouped together in Pisces.</p>

<p>The Circlet is a very striking group forming a pentagon. The glass
reveals two faint stars in addition, making the figure seven-sided or
elliptical in form.</p>

<p>As to the number of the stars as classified according to their
magnitude, that is their brightness, it may be mentioned that there
are approximately 20 stars of the first magnitude, 65 of the second,
300 of the third, and 450 of the fourth. We cannot see stars fainter

the prehistoric icthyosaurus, while some see in the outline an easy
chair. The head of the beast is characterized by a clearly traced
pentagon, about 20&deg; southeast of Aries. The brightest star in the
constellation is <ins class="character" title="Greek alpha">&#945;</ins> of the second magnitude. It is at one apex of the
pentagon, about 15&deg; east of Al Rischa in Pisces, and 37&deg; directly
south of Algol.</p>

<p>The noted variable Mira also known as <ins class="character" title="Greek omicron">&#959;</ins> Ceti is the chief object of
interest in this constellation.</p>

<p>It was discovered by Fabricius in 1596 and varies from the ninth
magnitude to the third or fourth in a period of 334 days. It can be
observed during its entire range with a 3" glass.</p>

<p>In 1779 Mira is reported to have been as bright as the first-magnitude
star Aldebaran. It lies almost exactly on a line joining <ins class="character" title="Greek gamma">&#947;</ins> and <ins class="character" title="Greek zeta">&#950;</ins> Ceti
a little nearer the former. Ten degrees south of it are four faint
stars about 3&deg; apart forming a square.</p>

<p><ins class="character" title="Greek tau">&#964;</ins> Ceti is one of our nearest neighbors at a distance of nine light

<h2><a name="TAURUS_ta_-rus_THE_BULL_Face_Southwest" id="TAURUS_ta_-rus_THE_BULL_Face_Southwest"></a>TAURUS (t&acirc;&acute;-rus)&mdash;THE BULL. (Face Southwest.)</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Location</span>.&mdash;Taurus contains the well-known and unmistakable group the
Pleiades, on the right shoulder of the Bull. A "V" shaped group known
as the Hyades is just to the southeast of the Pleiades, in the face of
the Bull, forming one of the most beautiful objects in the sky.</p>

<p>The brightest star in Taurus is Aldebaran, a ruddy-hued star known as
"The Follower." It is at the beginning of the "V" in the Hyades, and
is at the apex of a triangle formed by Capella, in Auriga, and <ins class="character" title="Greek alpha">&#945;</ins>
Persei, and equally distant from them both.</p>

<p>The star <ins class="character" title="Greek beta">&#946;</ins> called Nath, is peculiarly white, and is common to Taurus
and Auriga. It represents the tip of one of the Bull's horns, and the
right foot of the Charioteer. The Pleiades are mentioned in Chinese
annals in 2357 <span class="smcap">b.c.</span> On a photograph of the group over 2000 stars have
been counted.</p>

<p>The ecliptic passes a little south of a point midway between the two
horns, where a scattered and broken stream of minute stars can be
seen.</p>

<p>Note two pretty pairs in the Hyades, one south of Aldebaran, the other
northwest of it.</p>

<p>There are rich clusters below the tip of the horn over Orion's head.</p>

<p>Taurus was an important object of worship by the Druids.</p>

<p>Aldebaran is near one eye of the Bull, and used to be called "The
Bull's Eye." An occultation of it by the moon, which not infrequently
occurs, is a striking phenomenon.</p>

<p>The Eskimos regard the Pleiades as a team of dogs in pursuit of a
bear. The group is receding from us at the rate of thirteen miles a
second and has a common eastward motion of about ten seconds a
century.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg&nbsp;97]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Location</span>.&mdash;Orion is considered the finest constellation in the
heavens. A line drawn from Nath to <ins class="character" title="Greek zeta">&#950;</ins> Tauri (the tips of the Bull's
horns), and extended 15&deg;, strikes the brilliant Betelgeuze in Orion,
known as the martial star. It forms the northeast corner of a
conspicuous parallelogram. The splendid first-magnitude star Rigel is
diagonally opposite Betelgeuze, and the girdle and sword of the Hunter
lie within the parallelogram, a very striking group. The former is
represented by three bright stars in a line 3&deg; long known as the
"Three Stars," because there are no other stars in the heavens that
exactly resemble them in position and brightness.</p>

<p>In the sword there is the most remarkable nebula in the heavens. It
may be seen with an opera-glass and in a telescope it is a wonderful
sight. Bellatrix is called the Amazon star. Note the contrasting
colours of <ins class="character" title="Greek alpha">&#945;</ins> and <ins class="character" title="Greek beta">&#946;</ins>.</p>

<p>About 9&deg; west of Bellatrix are eight stars in a curved line running
north and south. These point out the Lion's skin held in the Hunter's
left hand.</p>

<p>Below <ins class="character" title="Greek lamda">&#955;</ins> there are two stars forming a triangle with it. Flammarion
calls this region the California of the sky.</p>

<p>The celestial equator passes nearly through <ins class="character" title="Greek delta">&#948;</ins>.</p>

<p>Orion was worshipped in China during the one thousand years before our
era, and was known to the Chinese as the "White Tiger."</p>

<p>The Eskimos see in the Belt stars the three steps cut by some
celestial Eskimo in a steep snow bank to enable him to reach the top.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg&nbsp;99]</a></span></p>

<p>Four or five degrees south of Rigel are four faint stars which are in
the ear of the hare. They can be seen on a clear night with the naked

<p>The curved line of three stars <ins class="character" title="Greek theta">&#952;</ins>, <ins class="character" title="Greek eta">&#951;</ins>, and <ins class="character" title="Greek zeta">&#950;</ins>, are in the back of the
hare.</p>

<p>Lepus is about 18&deg; west of Canis Major, and, by reason of the earth's
motion, the Great Dog seems to be pursuing the Hare around the
heavens.</p>

<p>The first-magnitude stars that are visible in the winter season in
this latitude present a fine contrast in color. Even the untrained eye
can see a decided difference between the bluish white color of the
brilliant Sirius, the Dog star that the Belt stars point south to, and
Rigel, and the ruddy Betelgeuze. Procyon has a yellowish tinge and
resembles the condition of our sun, while Betelgeuze is surrounded by
heavy metallic vapors and is thought to be approaching extinction.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PLANETS" id="THE_PLANETS"></a>THE PLANETS.</h2>


<p>It is not within the scope of this work to dwell at length on a
discussion of the planets. Certain explanatory matter regarding them
is necessary, however, to prevent confusion; for the student must bear
in mind the fact that from time to time the planets appear in the
constellations, and unless identified would lead him to think that the
diagrams were inaccurate.</p>

<p>The reader is referred to any one of the four large plates that
precede each season. He will observe that a portion of an ellipse has
been traced on each of them, and that this line has been designated
the Ecliptic, which simply means the sun's apparent pathway across the
sky.</p>

<p>This pathway is divided into twelve equal parts of thirty degrees
each, and to these twelve divisions are given the names of the
constellations of the Zodiac in the following order: Aries (<ins class="character" title=" Symbol: Aries">&#9800;</ins>), Taurus
(<ins class="character" title="Symbol: Taurus">&#9801;</ins>), Gemini (<ins class="character" title="Symbol: Gemini">&#9802;</ins>), Cancer (<ins class="character" title="Symbol: Cancer">&#9803;</ins>), Leo (<ins class="character" title="Symbol: Leo">&#9804;</ins>), Virgo (<ins class="character" title="Symbol: Virgo">&#9805;</ins>), Libra (<ins class="character" title="Symbol: Libra">&#9806;</ins>), Scorpio
(<ins class="character" title="Symbol: Scorpio">&#9807;</ins>), Sagittarius (<ins class="character" title="Symbol: Sagittarius">&#9808;</ins>), Capricornus (<ins class="character" title="Symbol: Capricornus">&#9809;</ins>), Aquarius (<ins class="character" title="Symbol: Aquarius">&#9810;</ins>), Pisces (<ins class="character" title="Symbol: Pisces">&#9811;</ins>).</p>

<p>The sun, starting from the first degree of Aries, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg&nbsp;116]</a></span> first day of
spring, passes through one constellation a month. The planets follow
the same pathway.</p>

<p>Confusion, therefore, respecting their identity can only arise in
connection with a study of one of the twelve constellations named
above, so that whenever a star of any size is seen in one of these
constellations, not accounted for in the diagram, the student may
conclude that this is a planet; especially if the unknown star does
not twinkle. It now remains to identify the planet.</p>

<p>This can best be done by referring to an almanac, which states what
planets are above the horizon, and which are morning and evening
stars. By morning star is meant that the planet is east of the sun; by
evening star, that it is west of the sun.</p>

<p>If the planet is in the west, and very brilliant, it is safe to assume
that it is the planet Venus.</p>

<p>If it is brighter than any of the fixed stars, and is some distance
from the sun, it is doubtless the colossal Jupiter.</p>

<p>If it is very red, it will probably be Mars.</p>

<p>Saturn is distinguished because of its pale, steady, yellow light.</p>

<p>As for Mercury, Uranus, and Neptune, the former is very near the sun,
and seldom seen; while Uranus and Neptune are so inconspicuous as to
lead to no confusion on the part of the novice.</p>

<p>A few notes of interest relative to the planets follow, taking them up
in regular order passing outward from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg&nbsp;117]</a></span> the sun: Mercury, Venus, Mars,
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mercury</span>.</h3>

<p>Mercury is the nearest to the sun of any of the planets. On this
account, and because of its rapid changes, it is seldom seen.</p>

<p>The most favorable time for observing it is just after sunset, or just
before sunrise, during the months of March, April, August, and
September, when it may be seen for a few successive days.</p>

<p>The greatest distance it ever departs from the sun on either side
varies approximately from sixteen to twenty-eight degrees. Its motion
resembles a pendulum, swinging from one side of the sun to the other.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Venus</span>.</h3>

<p>Venus approaches nearer to the earth and is more brilliant than any
other planet. It is bright enough to cast a shadow at night, and is
sometimes visible even at noonday. It is almost as large as the earth,
and appears to oscillate, as Mercury does, on either side of the sun.</p>

<p>It never appears more than three hours after sunset, and as long
before the sunrise, and is never more than forty-eight degrees from
the sun.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Mars</span>.</h3>

<p>Mars is most like the earth of any of the planets, and, although not
as interesting an object to view as the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg&nbsp;118]</a></span> more brilliant planets, Venus
and Jupiter, it claims our attention chiefly because of the surmises
respecting its habitability.</p>

<p>Mars appears to the naked eye as a bright red star, and when at a
favorable opposition to the earth (which occurs only once in every
fifteen years) it rivals Jupiter in splendor.</p>

<p>The planet may be mistaken for the first magnitude stars, Antares in
Scorpius, and Aldebaran in Taurus, near which it frequently passes.</p>

<p>The fixed stars, however, twinkle, while Mars glows steadily. If there
is any doubt in the student's mind as to the identity of the planet, a
few nights of observation, noting the changes in the planet's
position, will decide the point. It takes Mars about fifty-seven days
to pass through one constellation in the Zodiac.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Jupiter</span>.</h3>

<p>Jupiter is the largest of all the planets in the solar system, and it
is easily distinguished from the fixed stars because of its brilliancy
and splendor, exceeding in brightness all the planets excepting Venus,
and casting a perceptible shadow.</p>

<p>It moves slowly and majestically across the sky, advancing through the
Zodiac at the rate of one constellation yearly. It is therefore a
simple matter to forecast its position, for, in whatever constellation
it is seen to-day, one year hence it will be seen equally advanced in
the next constellation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg&nbsp;119]</a></span></p>

<p>Although Jupiter appears to move slowly, it really travels at the
incomprehensible rate of five hundred miles a minute.</p>

<p>The most interesting feature about Jupiter for the amateur astronomer
consists in observing four of its moons, which are visible with a
small telescope. They appear like mere dots of light, and their
transit of or occultation with the planet (that is, their
disappearance before or behind its disk) can be watched, and is a
never failing source of pleasure. A large telescope alone reveals
Jupiter's four other moons.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Saturn</span>.</h3>

<p>Saturn is farther removed from the earth than any of the planets in
the solar system, visible to the naked eye. It is distinguished from
the fixed stars by the steadiness of its light, which is dull and of a
yellow hue, though to some it appears to be of a greenish tinge. It
seems barely to move, so slow is its motion among the stars, for it
takes two and one half years to pass through a single constellation of
the Zodiac.</p>

<p>Saturn has eight moons. Titan, its largest one, can be seen with a 3"
glass. Its celebrated rings are telescopic objects but a small glass
reveals them.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Uranus</span>.</h3>

<p>The student will hardly mistake Uranus for a fixed star, as it is only
under the most favorable circumstances that it can be seen with the
naked eye.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg&nbsp;120]</a></span></p>

<p>At its nearest approach to the earth, it is as bright as a
sixth-magnitude star. Uranus is accompanied by four moons, and takes
seven years to pass through a constellation of the Zodiac.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Neptune</span>.</h3>

<p>Neptune is the most distant of the planets in the solar system, and is
never visible to the naked eye.</p>

<p>The earth comes properly under a discussion of the planets, but a
description of it is hardly within the scope of this work.</p>

<p>Confusion in identifying the planets is really confined to Mars and
Saturn, for Venus and Jupiter are much brighter than any of the fixed
stars, and their position in the heavens identifies them, as we have
seen before.</p>

<p>The following table of first-magnitude stars in the Zodiacal
constellations confines the question of identifying the planets to a
comparison of the unknown star with the following-named stars:</p>

<p>The first four stars named above are white in color, so that either
Mars or Saturn is readily distinguished from them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg&nbsp;121]</a></span></p>

<p>As for Aldebaran and Antares, which are both red stars, not unlike
Mars and Saturn in color and magnitude, the fact that the latter do
not twinkle, and that they do not appear in the diagrams, should
satisfy the observer of their identity. Reference to an almanac, or a
few nights of observation, will in any case set at rest any doubt in
the matter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg&nbsp;122]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="THE_MILKY_WAY" id="THE_MILKY_WAY"></a>THE MILKY WAY.</h2>


<p>The Milky Way, or Galaxy as it is sometimes called, is a great band of
light that stretches across the heavens. Certain portions of it are
worthy of being viewed with an opera-glass, which separates this
seemingly confused and hazy stream into numberless points of light,
emanating from myriads of suns.</p>

<p>This wonderful feature of the heavens is seen to best advantage during
the months of July, August, September, and October. Beginning near the
head of Cepheus, about thirty degrees from the North Pole, it passes
through Cassiopeia, Perseus, Auriga, part of Orion, and the feet of
Gemini, where it crosses the Ecliptic, and thence continues into the
southern hemisphere, beyond our ken in these latitudes.</p>

<p>It reappears in two branches in the region of Ophiuchus, one running
through the tail of Scorpius, the bow of Sagittarius, Aquila,
Delphinus, and Cygnus; the other above and almost parallel to it,
uniting with the first branch in Cygnus, and passing to Cepheus, the
place of beginning.</p>

<p>The student should note especially the strange gap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg&nbsp;125]</a></span> between <ins class="character" title="Greek alpha">&#945;</ins>, <ins class="character" title="Greek gamma">&#947;</ins>, and
<ins class="character" title="Greek epsilon">&#949;</ins> Cygni. This dark space has been called the "Coal Sack."</p>

<p>The Milky Way in the vicinity of Cassiopeia is particularly rich, and
well repays a search with an opera-glass.</p>

<p>"The Galaxy covers more than one tenth of the visible heavens,
contains nine-tenths of the visible stars, and seems a vast
zone-shaped nebula, nearly a great circle of the sphere, the poles
being at Coma and Cetus."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg&nbsp;126]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="THE_MOTIONS_OF_THE_STARS" id="THE_MOTIONS_OF_THE_STARS"></a>THE MOTIONS OF THE STARS.</h2>


<p>It may be that the student desires to proceed in this conquest of the
sky at a more rapid pace than the scheme of study permits. To assist
such, it should be borne in mind that the circumpolar constellations,
as Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, Draco, Cepheus, and Cassiopeia, are
designated,&mdash;are visible in our latitude in the northern sky every
night.</p>

<p>A reference to their diagrams, and a glance at any of the large plates
showing the entire group in their respective positions, will suffice
for the student to identify them.</p>

<p>The hours of darkness alone limit the speed with which a knowledge of
the constellations can be acquired.</p>

<p>Let us suppose that the student begins his search for the
constellations on the night of April 1st, at nine <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> He has for his
guide the large plate, and the spring group of eleven constellations
set forth in the diagrams. The remaining three constellations of the
circumpolar group are, as we have seen before, visible in the north.</p>

<p>If he faces the western sky, he will see Andromeda just setting, and
Perseus, Taurus, Orion, Lepus, and Canis Major but a short distance
above the horizon. If<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg&nbsp;127]</a></span> he is so fortunate as to be able to identify
these, and the spring group, he may turn his attention wholly to the
eastern sky, where new constellations await him.</p>

<p>In the southeast he may see Virgo. In the east well up blazes
Arcturus, the gem of Bo&ouml;tes, below which is the beautiful Northern
Crown, with the diamond in the head of Serpens beneath it. Hercules is
rising, and Vega in the Lyre should be seen just flashing on the view
in the northeast.</p>

<p>This completes the list of wonders visible at this precise time, but
the stars apparently are never still, and doubtless, while the student
has been passing from one constellation to another in the western and
southern skies, others have been rising in the east and northeast.</p>

<p>At ten <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> the Lyre is well up, and Ophiuchus and Libra can be
discerned. At midnight Scorpius and Cygnus are ready to claim the
attention. By two o'clock <span class="smcap">a.m.</span>, Aquila, Delphinus, and Sagittarius
have risen, and at break of day Andromeda, Pegasus, and Capricornus
can be seen if the student has had the courage to remain awake this
length of time.</p>

<p>In no way can the seeming movement of the stars be better understood
than by actual observation. The observer must bear in mind that the
movement is an apparent one: that it is the earth that is moving and
not the stars. He has only to think of the analogy of the moving train
beside the one that is standing still, and the true state of affairs
will at once be evident.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg&nbsp;128]</a></span></p>

<p>To further appreciate this apparent change in the situation of the
constellations, the student should refer to the large plates
successively. In each successive one he will note the advancement
westward of the constellations mentioned above, rising in the east
late at night.</p>

<p>The student can best get an idea of this westward apparent movement of
the stars by noting the position of some bright first-magnitude star
from night to night. He will soon be able to calculate the position of
this star a month or more ahead, and this calculation applies to all
the constellations and stars.</p>

<p>It is not within the scope of this work to go into this matter in
detail. The author merely desires to mention this fact of apparent
change of position in the stars, a fact that will be noticeable to the
observer in a short time, and a fact that it is hoped he will be able
to explain to his own satisfaction with the aid of the foregoing
remarks.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the stars on the diagrams are all numbered and
lettered. The numbers refer to the magnitude of the star,&mdash;that is,
the brightness of it, the first-magnitude stars being the brightest,
the second-magnitude stars two-and-a-half times less bright, etc.</p>

<p>The letters are those of the Greek alphabet, and the student if not
familiar with it is advised to consult a Greek grammar.</p>

<p>In the text, in referring to certain stars in the constellations,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg&nbsp;129]</a></span> the
genitive case of the Latin name of the constellation is given; for
example, Vega is known as <ins class="character" title="Greek alpha">&#945;</ins> Lyrae, meaning alpha of Lyra, Aldebaran as
<ins class="character" title="Greek alpha">&#945;</ins> Tauri, alpha of Taurus, etc.</p>

<p>The twilight hour affords an excellent opportunity of fixing the
relative positions of the first-magnitude stars in the mind, for at
that time they alone, save the planets, are visible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg&nbsp;130]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="METEORS_OR_SHOOTING-STARS" id="METEORS_OR_SHOOTING-STARS"></a>METEORS, OR SHOOTING-STARS.</h2>


<p>As this work is designed primarily to cover what is observable in the
starlit heavens with the naked eye, the subject of meteors, or
shooting-stars, comes properly within its scope.</p>

<p>There are few persons, if any, who have not witnessed the sight of a
splendid meteor speeding across the sky, and such a sight always calls
forth exclamations of wonder and delight.</p>

<p>Apparently these evanescent wanderers in space are without distinctive
features, and baffle classification; but, like all that nature reveals
to us, they have been found, for the most part, to conform to certain
laws, and to bear certain marks of resemblance that permit of their
identification and classification.</p>

<p>By careful observation for over fifty years the meteors, generally
speaking, have been so arranged that they come under the head of one
of the nearly three hundred distinct showers which are now recognized
by astronomers.</p>

<p>Many of these showers are too feeble and faint to be worthy of the
attention of one not especially interested in the subject, but certain
ones are well worth observing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg&nbsp;131]</a></span> There is always a pleasure in being
able to recognize at a glance a certain definite manifestation of
nature, be it a rare flower or a flashing meteor.</p>

<p>The generally accepted theory respecting the meteors is that they were
all originally parts of comets now disintegrated, and the four
well-known showers of April 20th, August 10th and 14th, and November
27th, bear testimony to this theory.</p>

<p>The apparent velocity of the meteors is between ten and forty-five
miles a second, and their average height is about seventy-six miles at
first appearance, and fifty-one miles at disappearance. Occasionally a
meteor is so large and compact as to escape total destruction, and
falls to the earth. Specimens of these meteorites are to be found in
our best museums.</p>

<p>I have seen fit to divide the principal meteor showers into four
groups, according to the seasons in which they appear, and have placed
them respectively at the conclusion of each season's work on the
constellations.</p>

<p>By radiant point is meant the point from which the meteors start on
their flight. This point is an apparent one, however, due to an
illusion of perspective, for the meteors really approach the earth in
parallel paths.</p>

<p>The dates given for these showers are those of the maxima, and the
meteors should be looked for several nights before and after the dates
specified.</p>

<p>The showers that are to be seen after midnight are, unless of special
note, omitted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg&nbsp;132]</a></span></p>

<p>There are, besides the meteors that have been classified, certain
shooting-stars that apparently have no determined radiant point. These
are called sporadic meteors.</p>

<p>In these lists of meteors, the radiant point is only approximately
given; for scientific purposes a far more exact position is required
in terms of right ascension and declination. There are several good
lists of meteoric showers to be obtained, which afford this
information for those who care to pursue the matter more in detail.
See the Rev. T.W. Webb's book, entitled <i>Celestial Objects for Common
Telescopes</i>. For purposes of identification, the radiant points here
given will be found for the most part sufficient.</p>


<p>NOTE.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Many readers of this book may be the fortunate possessors of
small telescopes. It may be that they have observed the
heavens from time to time in a desultory way and have no
notion that valuable and practical scientific research work
can be accomplished with a small glass. If those who are
willing to aid in the great work of astrophysical research
will communicate with the author he will be pleased to
outline for them a most practical and fascinating line of
observational work that will enable them to share in the
advance of our knowledge respecting the stars. It is work
that involves no mathematics, and its details are easily
mastered.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg&nbsp;133]</a></span></p>

<h2>Popular Books on Astronomy</h2>
<hr style="width: 45%;" />
<h3>By William Tyler Olcott</h3>


<p><i>Excellently arranged, and copiously illustrated, these little
manuals&mdash;real field-books&mdash;should prove valuable for all who want to
become familiar with the stars</i></p>


<h1>A Field Book of the Stars</h1>

<p><i>16mo. With Fifty Diagrams.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>To facilitate the fascinating recreation of star-gazing the
author has designed this field-book. All matters of a
technical or theoretical nature have been omitted. Only what
the reader can observe with the naked eye or with an
opera-glass have been included in it. Simplicity and brevity
have been aimed at, the main idea being that whatever is
bulky or verbose is a hindrance rather than a help when one
is engaged in the observation of the heavens.</p></div>


<h1>In Starland with a Three-Inch Telescope</h1>

<p>A Conveniently Arranged Guide for the Use of the Amateur Astronomer</p>

<p><i>16mo. With Forty Diagrams of the Constellations and Eight of the
Moon.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The <i>raison d'etre</i> therefore for the book is convenience
and arrangement. The author has found by experience that
what the student most needs when he is observing with a
telescope, is a page to glance at that will serve as a guide
to the object he desires to view, and which affords concise
data relative to that object. The diagrams therefore direct
the student's vision and the subject-matter affords the
necessary information in each case.</p></div>


<h1>Star Lore of All Ages</h1>

<p>A Collection of Myths, Legends, and Facts Concerning the
Constellations of the Northern Hemisphere</p>

<p><i>8vo. Fully Illustrated.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Will appeal alike to those who are interested in folk-lore
and those who are attracted by astronomy. In it the author
has gathered together the curious myths and traditions that
have attached themselves from the earliest times to
different constellations and even to individual stars.</p></div>

<h1>The Essence of Astronomy</h1>

<h3>Things Every One Should Know About the Sun, Moon and Stars</h3>

<h2>By Edward W. Price</h2>

<p><i>12mo. Fully Illustrated.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Here is a volume quite different from the usual "popular
book on astronomy."</p>

<p>It answers in untechnical language the every-day questions
of every-day people, the material being so arranged that it
is readily available for quick reference use, as well as for
interesting consecutive reading.</p>

<p>An individual chapter is devoted to each member of the Solar
System. Special space is given to "Curiosities of the
Skies."</p>

<p>The illustrations are from photographs taken at the great
observatories. The drawings of Mars are the most recent
published, being made by Professor Lowell in January, 1914.</p>

<p>The chronological table and annotated bibliography are of
real value.</p></div>


<h1>Sun Lore of All Ages</h1>

<h3>A Collection of Myths and Legends Concerning the Sun and its Worship</h3>

<h2>By William Tyler Olcott</h2>

<p class='center'>Author of "Star Lore of All Ages," "A Field Book of the Stars," etc.</p>

<p><i>8vo. With 30 Illustrations.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A companion volume to <i>Star Lore of All Ages</i> by the same
author. It comprises a compilation of the myths, legends,
and facts concerning the sun, of equal interest to the
lay-reader or to the student.</p>

<p>The literature of the subject is teeming with interest,
linked as it is with the life story of mankind from the
cradle of the race to the present day, for the solar myth
lies at the very foundation of all mythology, and as such
must forever claim pre-eminence.</p></div>

<h1>Astronomy in a Nutshell</h1>

<h3>The Chief Facts and Principles Explained in Popular Language for
General Readers and for Schools</h3>

<h2>By Garrett P. Serviss</h2>

<p><i>Cr. 8vo. With 47 Illustrations.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Presents the subject of astronomy in a succinct, popular
form. No mathematical knowledge beyond the simplest outlines
is assumed on the part of the reader. The great underlying
facts and principles of astronomy are presented in a shape
which any intelligent person can comprehend. The book may be
used either for self-instruction or for schools.</p></div>

<p class='center'><i>16mo. Adequately Illustrated.</i></p>

<p><i>No. 1. A History of the Science Series</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The author traces the evolution of intellectual thought in
the progress of astronomical discovery, recognizing the
various points of view of the different ages, giving due
credit even to the ancients. It has been necessary to
curtail many parts of the history, to lay before the reader
in unlimited space enough about each age to illustrate its
tone and spirit, the ideals of the workers, the gradual
addition of new points of view and of new means of
investigation.</p></div>


<h1>An Easy Guide to the Constellations</h1>

<h3>With a Miniature Atlas of the Stars</h3>

<h2>By James Gall</h2>

<p class='center'><i>New and Enlarged Edition, with 30 Maps 16mo.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This new edition of <i>An Easy Guide to the Constellations</i>
has been thoroughly revised: five additional plates have
been added, so as to include all the constellations of the
Zodiac, and render the book complete for Southern Europe and
the United States.</p></div>

the stars to the "Milky Way" and through observations of our
